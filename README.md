## Features 🎨

- Displays file and directory names like [`ls`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) in a text editor,
  and renames or moves them exactly as you edit them.
- A pre-compiled single executable without any dependencies.
  Thanks 💖 to [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/).
- Supports Linux, Mac and Windows.
- Supports wildcard patterns, including Windows.

### Caveats ⚠

- Given paths have to be convertible to UTF-8.
- Collisions are detected *as much as possible*, but *not perfectly*.
  Does not verify all paths such as hard links and symbolic links.

## Usage 🚀

```txt
Usage: moove [OPTIONS] [PATHS]...

Arguments:
  [PATHS]...  Paths or wildcard patterns to move

Options:
  -v, --verbose                    Verbose output
  -s, --sort                       Sort in the natural order
  -a, --absolute                   Treat as absolute paths
  -d, --directory                  Directories themselves, not their contents
  -w, --with-hidden                Include hidden files
  -e, --exclude-pattern <PATTERN>  Exclude regular expression pattern
  -c, --copy                       Copy without moving
  -u, --dry-run                    Dry-run
  -o, --oops                       Abort in case of collision (prompt as default)
  -f, --force                      Overwrite existing files without prompting
  -F, --force-dir                  Overwrite existing directories without prompting (implies --force)
  -q, --quiet                      No output to stdout/strerr even if error
  -h, --help                       Print help
  -V, --version                    Print version
```

- Displays file and directory names like [`ls`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) in a text editor.
- You can edit the list as you want to operate. The order of lines after editing corresponds to the original one. Empty lines will be ignored.
- Operations are canceled if you close the editor without saving.
- If a line starts with `//`, the file and directory (and its contents) will be removed regardless of modification of the remaining part of the line.
- Destination directories will be created automatically.
- In case of line number change or collision, asks whether to re-edit or abort. Aborts without asking if `--oops` is specified.
- With `--force`, an existing destination file (or symlink to a file) is overwritten without prompting. Errors if the destination is a directory or a symlink to a directory.
- With `--force-dir`, an existing destination directory (or symlink to a directory) is also overwritten: on move, the destination is removed and replaced; on copy, the contents are merged. Implies `--force` for file destinations. Errors if the source is a symlink to a directory.

### Configuration 🎚

- Default command line options can be specified by the environment variable `MOOVE_OPTIONS`.
- The default editor is searched in the following order.
  - environment variable `VISUAL`
  - environment variable `EDITOR`
  - hardcoded lists
  - platform-specific generic file openers
